Changes in simPopulation version 0.4.0
    
    + New function 'simRelation' for simulation of categorical predictor 
      variables with dependent relationships among household members.
    
    + New example data 'ghanaS' for the Ghana Living Standards Survey.
    
    + New demo 'ghana' for the simulation of Ghana Living Standards Survey data.
    
    + Added more functionality to account for structural zeros.
    
    + New argument 'probs' in 'getBreaks', 'simContinuous' and 'simEUSILC' 
      giving probabilities for (positive) break points based on quantiles.



Changes in simPopulation version 0.3
    
    + Functions 'simCategorical' and 'simContinuous' are now much more 
      memory-efficient and faster if there is a large number of possible 
      combinations in the categorical predictor variables.
    
    + Bugfix in 'simCategorical' regarding default value of basic variables.
    
    + Updated author affiliation.



Changes in simPopulation version 0.2.1
    
    + Small changes in vignette.


Changes in simPopulation version 0.2
    
    + New argument 'equidist' in 'getBreaks', 'simContinuous' and 'simEUSILC' 
      indicating whether (positive) break points should be equidistant.
    
    + Function 'continencyWt' is now generic and has an additional 'data.frame' 
      method for computing pairwise contingency coefficients.
    
    + Added package vignette 'simPopulation-eusilc'.
    
    + Bugfix in 'simStructure': if 'hsize' is not supplied, the resulting 
      variable is now an integer instead of an array.
    
    + New methods to choose from in 'simStructure' and 'simCategorical'.
    
    + New argument 'useNA' in 'tableWt' indicating whether to include extra NA 
      levels in the table.



Changes in simPopulation version 0.1.4
    
    + 'R CMD check' no longer produces a note.


Changes in simPopulation version 0.1.3
    
    + Bugfix: methods for the generic functions 'covWt' and 'corWt' are now 
      exported.


Changes in simPopulation version 0.1.2
    
    + Corrected typos in help file for 'quantileWt'.
    
    + Bugfix in 'simCategorical' in case of only one predictor variable.


Changes in simPopulation version 0.1.1

    + Argument 'const' added to functions 'simContinuous' and 'simEUSILC' so 
      that constant can be added before log transformation.
    
    + Bugfix in 'getCat': it produced an error for semi-continuous variables 
      when there were either no negative or no positive breakpoints.
    
    + Added help file for package.
